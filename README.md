# MCP: Build Rich-Context AI Apps with Anthropic

- The Model Context Protocol, or MCP, is an open protocol that standardizes how your LLM applications can get access to context in terms of tools and data resources based on the client-server architecture.
- It defines how communication takes place between an MCP client hosted inside your own LLM application, and an MCP server that exposes tools and data resources and prompt templates to your application.
